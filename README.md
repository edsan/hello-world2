# hello-world2
another hello world 

four score and sever years ago
our fathers brought forth in this continent
a new nation under god

oh captain my captain
our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every rock
the prize we sought is won

i light the fire
while you place the flower in the bough
that you bough today
